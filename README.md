# Surf-Text-Hotline
Web scrapping Twillio app to get up to date surf 


# Surf_Alerts
<h1>Why the this Application</h1>
<p1>To start I love working with Twillio and wanted to leverage their service from somthing I love, surfing. When I'm staying out on the coast for a few days it can be difficult to get a strong enough signal to check the surf report of different beaches. I wanted to create an app where I could send a text message and recieve the current surf data of specific beaches in Oregon</p1>

<h1>How this app works</h1>
<p1>This app scrapes  surf reports using BeautifulSoup as well as DarkSky's api for popular surfing locations in Oregon. When the hosted twillio number recieves  a text with the desired location it retrieves the relevant information and send this back to the texter
